Welcome to the repository! Here you'll find all the files and associated material for [Howework 8](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw08/hw08.html). 

For this assignment, I chose to modify Deans Attali's [tutorial](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/) and [code](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/#12-final-shiny-app-code) in order to create my own version of the the British Columbia Liquor store Shiny app.

My app is hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io), and available [**here**](https://smc-test-shiny.shinyapps.io/British_Columbia_Liquor_Prices/).

If you would like to reference or reproduce the modified code behind this app, you can find it in the repository [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw08-schignel/blob/master/bcl/app.R).


Best of luck with your selection. Cheers!
